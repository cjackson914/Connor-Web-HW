        <p>The process of making your own pasta can be broken down into six steps: assembling your equipment, choosing the ingredients, mixing and kneading the dough, resting the dough, rolling out the pasta and cutting it into noodles, and cooking it. The payoff is tremendous. Fresh pasta has a beautifully silky yet springy texture and a rich, almost buttery egg-yolk flavor that is far better than anything you can buy.</p>
